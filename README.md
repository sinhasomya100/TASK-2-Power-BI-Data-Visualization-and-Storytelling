1. Monthly Sales Trend (Area Chart)
A rising trend is observed from March to July, with a dip in August. July shows the peak — replicating July’s strategy may boost future months.

2. Sales Distribution by Country (Pie Chart)
Sales are fairly distributed among countries. India and USA contribute the highest — key targets for ads, expansion, and resource focus.

3. Product Category Sales (Bar Chart)
Highlights the top-performing product categories. Helps in understanding which categories are driving the most revenue and where to focus inventory or marketing efforts.

4. Sales by Payment Method (Donut Chart)
Visualizes preferred payment methods (e.g., Credit Card, UPI, COD). Useful for optimizing checkout experience and targeting promotions.

5. Hourly Sales Pattern (Line Chart)
